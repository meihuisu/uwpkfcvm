 The UW Parkfield velocity model describes 3D seismic P- and S-wave velocities from a tomographic 
inversion for crustal structure in the greater Parkfield region (Zeng et al., 2016). The 
inversion used the code tomoDD by Zhang and Thurber (BSSA, 2003), which inverts body-wave 
arrival times for 3D P- and S-wave velocity structure simultaneously with determining 
earthquake locations. A novel aspect of this model is that it used P- and S-wave arrivals 
from low-frequency earthquakes (LFEs) to improve resolution at greater depths than previous 
body-wave tomography studies of the Parkfield region. The coordinate system origin is 
(35° 57.60' N, -120° 30.28' W) with the Y-axis rotation to an azimuth of 139.2°.
